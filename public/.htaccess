# Activate URL rewriting
RewriteEngine On

# Rewrite all non-secure requests except localhost and loopback
# See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33025559/apache-rewriterule-everything-except-localhost-and-loopback
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^localhost [NC]
RewriteCond %{REMOTE_ADDR} !^127\.0\.0\.1$
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on
RewriteRule ^/?(.*) https://{HTTP_HOST}/$1 [R=301,L]

# Now, deal with the url rewriting for our app front controller 
# like myproject.com/controller/action/1/2/3

# If the following conditions are true, then rewrite the URL:
# If the requested filename is not a directory,
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

# ... and if the requested filename is not a regular file that exists,
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f

# ... and if the requested filename is not a symbolic link,
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-l

# ... then rewrite the URL in the following way:
# Take the whole request filename and provide it as the value of a
# "url" query parameter to index.php. Append any query string from
# the original URL as further query parameters (QSA), and stop
# processing this .htaccess file (L).

RewriteRule ^(.+)$ index.php?url=$1 [QSA,L]
